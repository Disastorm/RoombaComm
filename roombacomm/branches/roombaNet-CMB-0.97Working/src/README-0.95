RoombaComm: Roomba Control & Communications API, release 0.95
Copyright (c) 2006   Tod E. Kurt, tod@todbot.com

Quick Start for Java
--------------------
If you have a Roomba Serial Interface built and the 'roombacomm-java.zip'
library, you can quickly try both out by unzipping this file and running 
one of the examples:

% unzip roombacomm.zip
% cd roombacomm
% ./run-it.sh roombacomm.SimpleTest /dev/cu.KeySerial1

Assuming you have a serial device called "/dev/cu.KeySerial1", which you 
probably do if you have a Keyspan USA-19HS USB serial adapter.


Quick Start for Processing
--------------------------
If you have a Roomba Serial Interface built and the 'roombacomm-processing.zip'
library, you can quickly try out both by unzipping this file and running
one of the examples:

1. Unzip the 'roombacomm-processing.zip' file inside of Processing's
    'libraries' directory.  This will create a directory called 'roombacomm'.
2. Start Processing (or Restart if already running)
3. Create a New Sketch
3. Choose "Sketch->Import Library->roombacomm" menu item
4. Copy one of the Processing examples in the 'examples' directory of the
    roombacomm library (zipfile)




Compatibility
-------------
This library has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.4, and a little on 
Windows 2000, but everything is in place (particularly the RXTX native
libraries) for it to work on any version of Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.



Platform-specific Notes
-----------------------
Mac OS X:
---------
If you've never used RXTX before on your Mac OS X box, run the command:

% ./rxtxlib/macosx_setup.command

And then shutdown (not just log out) and log back in again.
And read this faq from Processing: http://processing.org/faq/bugs.html#serial

Also, if you use Bluetooth in 10.3, you can only input numeric passkeys,
which can make using Bluetooth adapters difficult.  If your Bluetooth
adapter can change its passkey (possible with the SparkFun/BlueRadios
devices), change it to a numeric passkey on a differernt computer. 
Or upgrade your OS. :)

Windows:
--------

The serial port implementation is a little different (at least to RXTX)
so use the '-hwhandshake' flag with the programs, if using Bluetooth on 
Windows.  See, 'RoomabCommSerial.waitForDSR' for details.

(And yes, I know the build, configuration, and release of this library 
is a little goofball, but I wanted to get something out so others can play)
