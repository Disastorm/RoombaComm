Good parts to read first: (<span class="sect1"><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.intro.whatis.html">What
Is Subversion?</a></span>, <span class="chapter"><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.basic.html">Fundamental

</h3>

<div class="quote">
For projects that have a large number of contributors, it's common for
most people to have working copies of the trunk. Whenever someone needs
to make a long-running change that is likely to disrupt the trunk, a
standard procedure is to create a private branch and commit changes
there until all the work is complete.<br />
</div>

<h3><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.whatis.html">ref</a>:
What is a branch?</h3>

<div class="quote">This is the basic concept of a <em class="firstterm">branch</em>-namely,
a line of development that exists independently of another line, yet
still shares a common history if you look far enough back in time. A
branch always begins life as a copy of something, and moves on from
there, generating its own history (see <a class="xref" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.whatis.html#svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1" title="Figure&nbsp;4.1.&nbsp;Branches of development">Figure&nbsp;4.1, Branches
of development</a>).</div>

<h3><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.concepts">ref</a>:
What's the point of a branch?</h3>

<div class="quote">You should
remember two important lessons from this section. First, Subversion has
no internal concept of a branch-it knows only how to make copies. When
you copy a directory, the resultant directory is only a "<span>branch</span>"
because <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> attach that meaning
to it. You may think of the directory differently, or treat it
differently, but to Subversion it's just an ordinary directory that
happens to carry some extra historical information.<br />
<br />
Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's branches exist as <span class="emphasis"><em>normal filesystem directories</em></span> in the
repository. This is different from other version control systems, where
branches are typically defined by adding extra-dimensional "<span class="quote">labels</span>" to collections of files. The location
of your branch directory doesn't matter to Subversion. Most teams
follow a convention of putting all branches into a <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, but you're free to invent
any policy you wish.<br />

<h2>A few words about this project's tree managment approach:</h2>

The structure will be as follows:<br />

/roombacomm<br />

&nbsp; ../trunk<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where the bleading edge development
and believed to be fully working code for this project can be found.
The structure should be
usable as an SVN checkout&nbsp; for the project source tree. In general
the idea is that /trunk will be usable at all times. More deatils about
the structure of the project in a seperate <a href="DirectoryStructure.html">document</a>.<br />

<br />

&nbsp; ../branches<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These branches are planed to be of one of two
types: experemental or releases.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experemental branches:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where long running development efforts
will take place for the project. Each branch should follow the projects
naming
convention based on the type of branch. (See "SVN policies of this
project" for details) In general, these branches should be considered
"under development" or "experimental" and under the control of a
developer. When the branch reaches a stability point, where the code
implmentes the changes that are desired for the branch, has implemented
any now needed testing code, and the code still passes all tests for
the project then the branch is
ready to be merged back into the trunk.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Release branches are points of code development
where it has been tested, prepaired, and packaged as a step forward for
the project.<br />

<br />

<h2>SVN policies of this project:</h2>

<ol>

  <li>all svn commits should have comments/log entries. (prefereably
identifying each file that was altered and in laymen terms what was
changed in that file)</li>
  <li>the keyword Id should be included in a comment in every file (do
not forget to set the svn:keywords property on the file too.)</li>
  <li>/branches/release-N.N.N will be official releases of the project</li>
  <li>experemental branches are encouraged when <strong><em>any or all</em></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>of the following
is true:
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 618px; margin-left: 34px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 516px;">the
development effort will
take more than one commit to achieve</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 516px;">the change is
likely to
break any backwards compatibility in
the current/previous release</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 516px;">automated
testing failed,
or the changes are not yet covered by
automated testing</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>code in compiled form should not be in SVN unless it is <strong><em>at
least one</em></strong> of the following:
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 618px; margin-left: 34px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 529px;">an outside
library that is
included for simplicity/compatibility (best done with a <span class="sect1"><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html">Vendor
Branch</a>)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 529px;">it is in a
packaged release for the
project</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>All new features developed must include automated testing code to
validate the function.The tests should be constructed in accordance with the format and approach that
the project is using for automated testing.<br />
  </li>
</ol>
