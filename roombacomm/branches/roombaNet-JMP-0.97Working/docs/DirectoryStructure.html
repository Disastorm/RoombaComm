<h1>Directory Structure</h1>
This page defines the directory structure standard used in this
project. It is based on the recommendations in the developer.com <a
 href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/994991/Building-with-Ant-Directory-Structure.htm">article
here</a>.&nbsp;
<br>
<h2>The Directories</h2>
The directories described below are relative to the project source
tree, as would be checked out of SVN at
http://svn.dprg.org/repos/roomba/roombacomm/trunk<br>
<br>
Two trees are supplied by the project: <br>
<ol>
  <li>the full developer tree, described below</li>
  <li>the user tree, which is the contents of the dist directory after
building the full developer tree</li>
</ol>
The intent is that the dist directory contains everything a user needs
to run the applications, but not the source. It is considered good
practice to separate the runnable application from the source, which
contains much more that users aren't typically interested in. <a
 name="dir">
