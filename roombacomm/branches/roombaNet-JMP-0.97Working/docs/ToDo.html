      <li class="done">Bottom line (Dock and Checkrobot) Only visible

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check in web GUI into TOT &amp; make it work/build</li>
  <li>Update web app interface to include network IP connection &amp;
make web GUI match functionality of roombacomm GUI</li>
  <li>Rename bsquare to something better </li>
  <li>Put ser2net into the tree (subject to licensing)<br>
    <font class="help">What is the licensing question here?</font></li>
  <li>make ant build the tree, make a build &amp; a doc target &amp; an
install target (does what the build script used to do)</li>
  <li>make the dummy's buildit/makeit shell scripts &amp; put them in
the right directory both for source control &amp; for distribution</li>
  <li>restructure TOT to a new directory structure that&rsquo;s
documented &amp; standard </li>
  <li>Merge changes from JMP097Working to TOT</li>
</ul>
<h3>Docs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create readme for svn &amp; eclipse </li>
  <li>fix copyrights <br>
    <font class="help">What should the copyrights be? Can someone put
the standard info into this doc?</font></li>
  <li>make docs into hyperlinked html files </li>
  <li>document how to set up apache to make the web server work </li>
  <li>document how to make ser2net work as a network server on a router
(how to build/run) </li>
  <li>document the new directory structure</li>
</ul>
<h2>HI-WANT (we plan to put these in, but priorities may intercede) </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make BumpTurn &amp; others commandline programs work over the
network</li>
  <li>Make front bumper press stop the roomba's motors when driving in
controlled mode. </li>
  <li>make javadocs &amp; link into doc system </li>
  <li>Get permission to bundle MyGUI with this package, or document
where it can be found. Bundle it into the zip file</li>
</ul>
<h2>WANT (these are desirable and will be worked on opportunistically)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First time after poweron, the LEDs flash but don't stay on. Fix
it. (sometime, not necessarily for 0.97)</li>
  <li>Add Motor exerciser panel to RoombacommGui</li>
  <li>Make it so the model of roomba can be discovered (400 vs. 500
family, &amp; maybe sub-models within the family)</li>
  <li>move connection settings in roombacommGUI to its own dialog</li>
  <li>Fill out the the sensor numbers/groups for 5xx models, &amp;
develop masks &amp; figure out the corresponding reply length for the
extra groups, and for querylist (sometime, not necessarily for
0.97)</li>
  <li>Implement failsafe in ser2net or shell script on router</li>
  <li>Make roombasrvr able to serve the serial connection</li>
  <li>Evaluate additional API capabilities that Roombacomm should maybe
support, such as other sensor reading modes (querylist, stream),
scheduling capability or others </li>
  <li>Request permission from iRobot to publish the OI spec in the
release&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Fix net folder under roombacomm root - it won't build</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Fill out the the sensor numbers/groups for 5xx models,
&amp; develop masks &amp; figure out the corresponding reply length for
the extra groups, and for querylist</li>
  <li>First time after poweron, the LEDs flash but don't stay on. Fix
it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VERIFY (these are thought to be complete but need checking)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Change the GUI to deal with with smaller screens<br>
We have some users
running it on netbooks. Looking at the specs, seems they may have a
display as low as 1024x600 resolution. This does not leave room for the
task bar. So I think a version that is 480 height would make sense,
allowing for title-bar height etc, but width can be wider than 640 if
you want. </li>
  <li>Maybe move to some command line options for GUI layout
    <ul>
      <li>--GUI=1024x768 or --GUI=640x480</li>
      <li>--GUI=NNNxYYY (support of variable values?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Update Power LEDS for 500 series, also make the sliders work the
power leds in realtime. Paul thinks it works - what's broken?</li>
  <li>Update roombacmd - change baud rate to SCI/OI </li>
  <li>fix bug in simpletest on router if no parameters are given.</li>
  <li>Verify that roombacomm doesn't exit if there are no serial ports </li>
</ul>
